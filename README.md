# work-day-planner
A simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of the day.

## Description

I build this calendar app to easily help store events or appointments throughout the day. Time blocks are colorcoded to display grey as the past, red as the current and green as the future depending on the current time of the day. 

## Installation 
N/A

## Usage

To use this, the user can start by seeing the current day and time at the top of the calendar and start adding their events and appointments into the respective time blocks and block their calendar. The user will be able to view the work day broken down by the hour. It has a save button for each time block and alerts the user if their appointment has been added to the calendar. Their schedule is saved using local storage.
